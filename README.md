# Portfolio

This is a portfolio I made by using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) with Bootstrap.

The base theme was downloaded [here](https://bootstrapmade.com/), then, since I'm a perfectionist at heart I played with it until I got what I wanted.
Since this is my first website I can say I'm satisfied with it!
